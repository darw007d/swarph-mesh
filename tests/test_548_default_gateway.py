"""Card #548 — no loopback gateway default survives in swarph-mesh.

The mesh-gateway binds the tailnet IP ONLY (100.107.222.72:8788); localhost
has never been bound. A loopback DEFAULT fails as a bare "Connection refused"
with no cause named — and is invisible to exactly the people who would review
it, because their shells carry MESH_GATEWAY_URL. swarph-cli #546 proved the
class; this sweep keeps the class out of THIS repo.

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_548_default_gateway.py -v
